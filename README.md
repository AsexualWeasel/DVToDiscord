# DVToDiscord
This mod sends information to discord via commands from Derail Valley, When I created this mod, the build version was #90. 

Installation:
1.Open DVToDiscord.rar file
2.Copy the GamePath.txt to the game's main directory(this is gonna for the bot, to find the Stats folder)
3.Copy the DerailValleyStatusInfos folder to the game's main directory(to use configs)
4.Copy your game's directory into GamePath.txt (example: D:\steam\steamapps\common\Derail Valley) Dont do like this: D:\steam\steamapps\common\Derail Valley\ because it won't find your status files!
5.Copy DVToDiscord folder into your Mods folder.
6.In DerailValleyStatusInfos/Configs you have to change your playername. The discordbot will use that name to separate your data from other's.
  The name must be simple, and short(no special characters, only low capital letters and no éáóüöőúű characters in it. And I'm pretty sure you dont want to type command for 1 year).
 7.Start the game twice. Why? That's because the mod will create some folders and txt files to store your juicy data about your train. It will show you some errors if you jump in and out from you train. Its just because it can't write to file yet, and it will show you a tons of errors. So Double-tap the game. From then it shouldn't throw anything.
8.And have fun.
